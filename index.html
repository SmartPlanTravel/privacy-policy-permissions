    <div    style="margin-left: 200px;"    >
    
    Countless data protection laws around the world and Google itself requires this of app developers.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the Privacy Policy obligations you'll need to comply with for   Android app.</p>
 
<p>A note to remember is these laws apply to any app that collects the personal information of the residents. For example, if your company is based in Asia and you collect the data from a citizen in California, you must still comply with California laws.</p>
 
 <ul>
<li>What data is collected</li>
<li>What the data is used for</li>
<li>Who the data is shared with</li>
<li>How the data is protected</li>
<li>User rights</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Prominent_Disclosure">Prominent Disclosure</h3>
<p>Your Privacy Policy   "<em><a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">prominently disclosed</a>.</em>" It must be included in locations where users expect and don't expect to provide their personal information:</p>
 <h3 id="Consent">Consent</h3>
<p>  app  include a request for consent to collect information in a "<em>clear and unambiguous way</em>."</p>
<p>The user must provide consent in an "affirmative" way such as an I Accept button or checkbox for the consent to be <a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">acceptable</a>:</p>
 <h3 id="Permissions_And_Necessary_Data">Permissions and Necessary Data</h3>
<p>A request to use data must be "necessary" for the app to run and collected for "limited purposes." <a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">Permission</a> requested for undisclosed features is not allowed and data collection should only be used for what the user granted permission for.</p>
<p>If you need to use data for another purpose, then you must receive permission again:</p>
 <h3 id="Deceptive_Behavior">Deceptive Behavior</h3>
<p>Google strictly prohibits apps from engaging in <a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">deceptive behavior</a>. Examples of this would be misleading claims and deceptive changes to device settings:</p>
 <p>An app must include within its Privacy Policy accurate statements of its systems and how a user should expect the app to run.</p>
<p>When an app makes changes to its systems, users must be notified. The process for how changes are made must also be included in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 id="Sharing_Of_Data">Sharing of Data</h3>
<p>Oftentimes apps use <a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">third-parties</a> to help run their app, process payments, and analyze systems and functions (i.e., Google Analytics). If   app shares its users' data, you must notify users of this disclosure and to whom you share the data with:</p>
 <h3 id="Sensitive_Data_Access">Sensitive Data Access</h3>
<p>Google places additional restrictions on apps that collect sensitive data. "<em>Sensitive data</em>" can include financial/payment information, SMS contacts, and microphone and camera sensor data.</p>
<p>There are a few activities and restrictions you'll need to be aware of if you collect sensitive data: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial Payments</strong>: You must never publicly disclose the sensitive financial or personal identification numbers of users.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Public Phonebook Contacts</strong>: Google doesn't allow the unauthorized disclosure of this data.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Virus Functionality</strong>: If   app contains anti-virus functionality you must disclose this, along with how and why the data is used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Children">Children</h3>
<p>Google's Developer Policy states if   app's audience is children or is a combination of adults and children, you must comply with additional regulations. For apps whose audience is only children, you must be a part of Google's <a href="https://play.google.com/about/families/#!?zippy_activeEl=designed-for-families#designed-for-families">Designed for Families Program</a>. Apps that have a mixed audience have the option to participate in the program.</p>
<p>For apps that choose not to participate in the program, they must still comply with Google's other requirements.</p>
<p>Apps must include in their Privacy Policies what data is collected from children and the APIs and SDKs the app uses.</p>
<p>Google's Family Policy Requirements remind apps that in addition to complying with these regulations, they must comply with other laws, specifically the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act  .</p>
 <p>Not every Privacy Policy fits every app. It's important to tailor your policy to fit your specific app and its functions.</p>
<h3 id="What_Data_Is_Collected">What Data is Collected</h3>
<p>Typically, this is the first clause of your Privacy Policy. It discloses that the app collects data and what type of data is collected.</p>
<p><a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">Evernote</a> helps users organize and manage ideas by collecting a user's images, text, and other data that the company considers to be "content." Its Policy states the data it collects with specific examples:</p>
 <p>Evernote's Privacy Policy also advises that it collects emails and names when a user logs into Evernote using their Google Apps credentials and other third-party partners:</p>
 <h3 id="How_Data_Is_Used">How Data is Used</h3>
<p>  app must only collect data that is used for the necessary functions of the app. This is required by both Google and laws to protect users from the misuse of their information.</p>
<p><a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">Pinterest</a> provides a very robust list of ways it uses data for "legitimate interests." It breaks down legitimate interests into recommending pins, maintaining product and safety features, ads, and customization of accounts:</p>
 <h3 id="Storage_Of_Data">Storage of Data</h3>
<p>You must disclose how long you will store a user's data in your systems. You don't have to give a specific timeframe but can state you reserve the right to store the data for "<em>as long as necessary</em>."</p>
<p><a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">Snapchat</a> has an extensive storage data section because of its collection of a variety of data. Its Privacy Policy advises that some images are deleted immediately or are stored for longer, depending on the type of image. Personal information is stored longer than photos, such as account info and location data:</p>
 <p>Snapchat also includes a section stating it can't promise certain information will be deleted in a certain timeframe:</p>
 <h3 id="Sharing_Data">Sharing Data</h3>
<p>If you share or disclose data to third-parties you <strong>must</strong> disclose this to users. Whether you are sharing it within   app or to outside parties, users must be notified.</p>
<p>If available, links to third-parties' own Privacy Policies or services/features should be included.</p>
<p><a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">Niantic's</a> Privacy Policy for Pokemon GO includes a clause that explains it doesn't disclose information unless for specific reasons including to service providers, other players (for live events), third parties, and for the protection of others:</p>
 <p>This is especially important since the enactment of the <em>GDPR and the CCPA (CPRA)</em>, which both added/elaborated on user's rights.</p>
<p>The GDPR requires users to have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be informed</li>
<li>Withdraw consent</li>
<li>Erasure of their information in some cases</li>
<li>Notification</li>
<li>Restrict your processing of their data in some circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>The CCPA (CPRA) granted new rights to California users including the rights to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know what information is collected</li>
<li>Delete collected information</li>
<li>Opt-out of the sale of information</li>
<li>Non-discrimination when they exercise a right</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">Twitter</a> provides a whole section that advises how users can access/rectify their data, delete data, and object/restrict consent with links to where users can do this on their accounts:</p>
 <p>CalOPPA requires apps that collect the data of California residents to include a "<strong><em>  </em></strong>" clause that states how the app handles these signals.</p>
<p>DNT requests are a way users can request companies to not track their online activity. Apps do <em>not have to respond</em> to DNT requests or settings, but they <em>must state how they respond to them</em>.</p>
<p>The clause does not have to be long or complicated. It must simply notify the user of the app's practices like <a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">DoorDash</a> does here:</p>
 <p>All Privacy Policies   include your contact information for users to reach out to if they have questions or concerns. This typically includes an address, email address, phone number, and links to help or support centers.</p>
 
 <p>On a computer, the link will typically be included under the "Developer" section of the page along with other links users can access for more information about the app.</p>
<p><a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">Instagram</a> includes a link to its Privacy Policy, its website, and an email for tech support:</p>
<h3 id="Within_Your_Android_App">Within  Android App</h3>
<p>Under Google's Developer Policies, you must include a link to your Privacy Policy <strong>somewhere within   app</strong>. Luckily, there are multiple places you can do this.</p>
<h4 id="Settings_Page">Settings Page</h4>
<p>The most common place is on the Settings page of   app since most people will look there first to find out more information about the app.</p>
<p>Snapchat includes a link to its Privacy Policy in the app's Settings page that takes you directly to the Privacy Policy.</p>
 <h4 id="Pop_Ups">Pop-Ups</h4>
<p>Including a link in pop-ups or notifications when a user opens the app is another good place to link your Privacy Policy. These pop-ups can be about updates to the policy or when you first log into the app.</p>
<p><a href="www.SmartPlanTravel.com">Snapseed</a> includes a link to its Privacy Policy three times in a pop-up notifying users that the app's policy has changed:</p>
 <h4 id="About_Page">About Page</h4>
<p>You can also put the link on the About page on   app.</p>
 
<p>If you developed an app for an Android phone and collect your users' personal data, you must include a Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This is required by Google's Developer Policies and various laws. You must include a link to the policy in Google Play's database and in the app itself.</p>
<p>Here are a few things to remember when drafting your Privacy Policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disclose what data is collected</li>
<li>Disclose how the data is secured</li>
<li>Disclose who the data is shared with</li>
<li>Advise users of their rights</li>
<li>Make your Privacy Policy easily accessible and clear</li>
</ul>
<p>Link it within your   Google Play Store listing, as well as within   app itself.</p>

    ads
</a>
</h1>
<p>
    app contains ads. This includes ads delivered through third-party ad SDKs (Software Development Kit), display ads, native ads, and/or banner ads  Apps that contain ads will have a "Contains ads" label shown on their store listing. This label will be visible to all Play Store users.
</p>








<h1 >
    Banner and interstitials:
</a>
</h1>
<p>
    My app integrates with an Ad SDK to show banners and/or interstitials. I use the ad formats to monetize and/or promote my own products or apps.
</p>







<h1 >
    Native ads: 
</a>
</h1>
<p>
    My app includes ads natively indistinguishable from other content (for example, sponsored articles, ads within a feed, etc).
</p>






<h1 >
    House ads: 
</a>
</h1>
<p>
    My app renders a small ad banner, interstitial ad, ad wall, and/or widget to promote my other apps.
    You should answer "no" to having ads for purposes of the "Contains ads" label if you only cross-promote your other apps in the following ways:
    
    The app displays a More Apps* section in the main menu leading a user to your other apps
    The More Apps* option does not interfere with gameplay
    The More Apps* option does not confuse the user by embedding itself within the gameplay
    *Other acceptable substitutions for More Apps include More Games, More to Explore, Full Version, More, About Us, or your Developer Icon.</p>

We will note the date that revisions were last made to this Agreement at the bottom of this Agreement, and any revisions will take effect upon posting. We will notify registered users of our Services (such registered users to be referred to as “Account Holders”) of material changes to these terms and conditions by either sending a notice to the email address associated with the Account Holder’s profile or by placing a notice on our websites.

BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH SmartPlanTravel

</h2>

<p> 

    
Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally.

Restricting SmartPlanTravel License Rights.  You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the SmartPlanTravel Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the SmartPlanTravel Companies with a more limited license as described further below (such limited license to be referred to herein as a “Restricted License”).  You may make this election by selecting such Restricted License grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the SmartPlanTravel Companies to your Content pursuant to the license terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard License”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the SmartPlanTravel Companies shall not hold a Standard License to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the SmartPlanTravel Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard License), but shall be granted a “Restricted License” as to the balance of your Content as defined below: 

When you post your Content to the Services, the license you grant the SmartPlanTravel Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate, and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted License applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g., a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services.
 
As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted License, you can terminate the SmartPlanTravel Companies’ license rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services.  Correspondingly, you may terminate the SmartPlanTravel Companies’ license rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted License by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available here).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time.
 
The SmartPlanTravel Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the SmartPlanTravel Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others.  In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content.    
 
The SmartPlanTravel Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made "public" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. 
 
Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The license you grant the SmartPlanTravel Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted License”.

For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other SmartPlanTravel Companies services or programs is not subject to the Restricted License, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific SmartPlanTravel service or program.
Use of SmartPlanTravel Booking Services. The SmartPlanTravel Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already.

By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the SmartPlanTravel Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the SmartPlanTravel Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorized to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated.

AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING SmartPlanTravel COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE SmartPlanTravel COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO SmartPlanTravel, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS.

When you book a reservation facilitated by the SmartPlanTravel Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the SmartPlanTravel Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation.

The SmartPlanTravel Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The SmartPlanTravel Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request.

In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation.

    accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the SmartPlanTravel Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the SmartPlanTravel Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute the SmartPlanTravel Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the SmartPlanTravel Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the SmartPlanTravel Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that SmartPlanTravel does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The SmartPlanTravel Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and the SmartPlanTravel Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the SmartPlanTravel Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services.

    If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy, and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The SmartPlanTravel Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers.

    Booking Vacation Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of SmartPlanTravel corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travelers’ ability to (1) enter into vacation rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Vacation Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a vacation rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of SmartPlanTravel syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the SmartPlanTravel Companies group and that is why you see them on the SmartPlanTravel Companies’ websites.  As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the SmartPlanTravel Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Vacation Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by SmartPlanTravel corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage, or contract for any Vacation Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services.
    
    Because neither SmartPlanTravel nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Vacation Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travelers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Vacation Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Vacation Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Vacation Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user.
    
    
    For further information on Vacation Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for vacation rentals, visit SmartPlanTravel Companies' Vacation Rentals. By making a Vacation Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.
    
    If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
     </p>
    One of SmartPlanTravel corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a SmartPlanTravel corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Vacation Rental reservation or Experience.

SmartPlanTravel urges travelers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

We reserve the right to reclaim any username, account name, nickname, handle or any other user identifier for any reason without liability to you.

You agree that no joint venture, agency, partnership, or employment relationship exists between you and SmartPlanTravel and/or its corporate affiliates as a result of this Agreement or use of the Services.

Our performance of this Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this Agreement limits our right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to your access or use of the Services within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.

If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining provisions in this Agreement shall continue in effect.

This Agreement (and any other terms and conditions referenced herein) constitutes the entire agreement between you and SmartPlanTravel with respect to the Services and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and SmartPlanTravel with respect to the Services. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

The following sections shall survive any termination of this Agreement:

The terms and conditions of this Agreement are available in the language of the SmartPlanTravel websites and/or apps on which Services may be accessed.

The websites and/or apps on which Services may be accessed may not always be updated on a periodic or regular basis and consequently are not required to register as editorial product under any relevant law.

Fictitious names of companies, products, people, characters, and/or data mentioned in, on or through the Services are not intended to represent any real individual, company, product, or event.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits, save that SmartPlanTravel corporate affiliates shall be deemed express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

You are prohibited from transferring any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement to anyone else without our consent.

Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
